Hi,

I grew up in Scarsdale, and I've recently been working
in areas that one might call "data journalism" and
"data science". Quite naturally, I applied some of this
thinking to Scarsdale, and I've learned a decent bit.

I like doing things that matter to people, and you seem
to be on top of the government issues in Scarsdale, so
please tell me if there are any sorts of things you might
like to see. Also, I'll be in Scarsdale from November 6
to 12 and again around Thanksgiving, so I might be able
to meet in person, in case that's easier than email.
