Scarsdale Budget

Budget documents
-----
The budget documents are divided into sections by government body. Within each
body are three or four tables

1. **Department Summary** seems to be the overall summary for the body; it
    combines the figures from the other two tables.
2. **Position Summary** seems to be salaries.
3. **Division Summary** seems to be all expenses other than salaries.
4. **Revenue Summary** seems to contain all revenue. It is present only if the
    body has revenue.

It might be fun to pick out the information from these tables. I could look at
information over time, compare adopted to estimated, and so on.

The appendices have loads of interesting information, like the cost of leaf
removal and a schedule of debt. Appendix A1 is a summary of the year's budget.
I think that's a decent analysis to start with.

Statement documents
-----
The statements contain more detailed information, but I haven't yet figured out
what.
