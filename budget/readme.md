Budgets
=====
The budget documents are divided into sections by government body. Within each
body are three tables

1. **Department Summary** seems to be the overall summary for the body; it
    combines the figures from the other two tables.
2. **Position Summary** seems to be salaries.
3. **Division Summary** seems to be all expenses other than salaries.

It might be fun to pick out the information from these tables. I could look at
information over time, compare adopted to estimated, and so on.
