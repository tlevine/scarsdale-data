the Committee shall promptly advise the Building Inspector to require 
the owner to make application to the BAR for a certificate of 
appropriateness to determine the question of whether a demolition permit
 should be granted in whole or in part or denied and, if it is to be 
granted in whole or in part, whether any conditions should be imposed in

 In recent decades, federal and state legislation has been enacted along
 with strict regulatory action dealing with the collection, treatment, 
and discharge of human wastewater. The Village of Scarsdale manages and 
maintains 85 miles of a sanitary collection sewer within its borders. 
Volumes from the sewers flow into the Westchester County trunk sewer 
system and are treated at county sewage treatment plants, eventually 
discharging into the Long Island Sound. It is critically important that 
the Village maintain, repair, improve and replace, when necessary, 
components of its sanitary sewer collection system in order to reduce 
extraneous flows and illegal discharges into its collection system 
before such flows enter the county trunk lines. A major component of the
 extraneous flows into the sanitary sewer collection system is inflow 
and infiltration from groundwaters and poorly functioning storm drainage
 pipes. Municipalities must, by law, take action to fix and maintain 
sanitary sewer collection systems and storm drains to reduce all 
nonsanitary flows into the sanitary sewer system, as the additional 
volumes adversely impact the trunk lines and the ability to treat waste 
at treatment plants. </div> <div class="litem1" id="27123336" style="margin-left:1em"><span class="titleLink">B.</span>
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the "Clean Water
 Act," creates strict guidelines for municipalities for managing 
stormwater and sanitary sewer systems, with the goal of optimal public 
health and safety. Under Section 402(p)(3)(B) of the Clean Water Act, 
municipal separate stormwater sewer systems (MS4) are required to reduce
 pollutants in stormwater systems to the maximum extent practicable. To 
regulate such stormwater systems, the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) is authorized to enforce the Clean Water Act and to encourage 
municipalities to reduce harmful pollutants going into the stormwater 
system. Section 304(m) of the Clean Water Act sets forth guidelines 
which deal with discharges and pollutants. The Village of Scarsdale, 
which manages an MS4, must adhere to a set of six minimum measures in 
the administration of its stormwater system. One of those minimum 
measures is maintaining the separation of stormwater and sanitary sewer 
systems to prevent inflow between the two systems. </div> <div class="litem1" id="27123337" style="margin-left:1em"><span class="titleLink">C.</span>
 Section 824.11 of the Westchester County Code also mandates that 
municipalities "take immediate action to reduce extraneous flows of 
water due to infiltration, illegal inflow and illegal stormwater 
connections to tributary [sanitary] sewer systems within a 
municipality's borders which are adversely impacting upon many County 
POTW treatment plants in their ability to treat waste, comply with their
 State Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits (SPDES permits), 
and to protect and enhance the local environment." Therefore, a 
municipality must take all actions necessary to ensure that the sanitary
 sewer system and stormwater system are not integrated. </div> <div class="litem1" id="27123338" style="margin-left:1em"><span class="titleLink">D.</span>
 Article 14-F of the New York State General Municipal Law allows for 
municipalities to impose a sewer rent fee on real property, to be used 
solely for the maintenance, repair and improvements of the sanitary 
sewer system. These funds will help further facilitate the Village of 
Scarsdale's compliance with the federal, state, and county guidelines on
 sanitary sewer systems by establishing a steady stream of dedicated 
funding to perform the necessary maintenance, repairs and improvements 
to mitigate the infiltration and inflows from other sources, including, 
but not limited to, stormwater and other illicit connections to the 
sanitary sewer system. Compliance with federal, state, and county code 
further enhances and protects the public health, safety and welfare. </div>  </div>

 In 1972, amendments to the federal Water Pollution Control Act 
prohibited the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters from a 
point source unless authorized by a National Pollutant Discharge 
Elimination System (NPDES) permit. Improving water quality under this 
program focused on industrial wastewater and municipal sewage 
discharges. Once the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
 found an improvement in pollution control of these point source 
discharges, it shifted its regulatory focus to nonpoint source 
pollution, namely, urban stormwater runoff. A series of studies in the 
1980s identified many pollutants in stormwater discharges from a variety
 of sources, including streets, parking lots, lawns, construction sites,
 maintenance facilities and other urban commercial and industrial uses. 
As a result, in 1990, the EPA established Phase I stormwater regulations
 for large communities with populations greater than 100,000 which 
required National/State Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits 
for certain municipal and industrial stormwater discharges. In 1991, 
Phase II of these regulations was finalized, requiring smaller 
communities within urbanized areas to develop plans for the control of 
stormwater within their jurisdictions by March 2003 with full 
implementation by 2008. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6438930" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(2)</span>
 The Village of Scarsdale, as an operator of a municipal separate storm 
sewer system (MS4), is subject to these permitting requirements as its 
population is greater than 10,000 and its population density is greater 
than 1,000 per square mile. The initial step toward providing a 
stormwater pollution prevention plan under Phase II is to develop and 
implement six minimum measures, including public education, public 
involvement, detection and elimination of illicit connections, 
construction site runoff, post-construction stormwater controls, 
pollution prevention and good housekeeping. This legislation is intended
 to address a number of these measures. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6438931" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(3)</span>
 The various provisions of this chapter are intended to regulate the 
impacts of construction activity in the Village on soil erosion and 
stormwater runoff. Stormwater runoff for single-family residences is 
typically managed with the installation of dry wells, detention basins, 
catch basins, driveway and/or curtain drains, or piping to the nearby 
existing municipal storm sewer system. Erosion control measures include 
the installation of silt fences and hay bales around properties during 
construction. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6438932" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(4)</span>
 This chapter differentiates large construction projects involving land 
disturbing activities of greater than 5,000 square feet and land 
disturbing activities greater than 1,500 square feet on lands located in
 a federally mapped floodplain, mapped New York State or local wetland 
or a local critical subdrainage basin by requiring comprehensive 
analyses and support data for such projects. Projects involving land 
disturbing activity of up to and less than 5,000 square feet and up to 
and less than 1,500 square feet on lands located in a federally mapped 
floodplain, mapped New York State or local wetland or a local critical 
subdrainage basin are required to submit more basic information. On lots
 7,500 square feet or less, projects involving land disturbing activity 
less than 200 square feet are not subject to the requirements of this 
chapter. On lots greater than 7,500 square feet, projects involving land
 disturbing activity less than 500 square feet are not subject to the 
provisions of this chapter. This chapter also establishes methods for 
controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate 
storm sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the New
 York State Pollution Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) permit 
process. </div> <div class="litem2" id="13281275" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(5)</span>
 All activities that occur as a result of Planning Board approval, 
including, but not limited to, subdivisions, site plans, wetlands, and 
special use permits, shall comply with the requirements of this chapter 
in addition to §&nbsp;<span class="xref">A319-37</span> of this Code. In such cases, the Planning Board shall give consideration to the requirements of this chapter. </div>  <div class="litem1" id="6438933" style="margin-left:1em"><span class="titleLink">B.</span>
 Findings. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation 
(NYSDEC) has found that uncontrolled drainage and runoff associated with
 land development have a significant impact upon the health, safety and 
welfare of the community. Specifically:  </div> <div class="litem2" id="6438934" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(1)</span> Stormwater runoff can carry pollutants into receiving water bodies, degrading water quality. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6438935" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(2)</span> The increase in nutrients in stormwater runoff such as phosphorus and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6438936" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(3)</span>
 Improper design and construction of drainage facilities can increase 
the velocity of runoff, thereby increasing streambank erosion and 
sedimentation. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6438937" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(4)</span> Construction involving land clearing and the alteration of natural topography increases erosion. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6438938" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(5)</span>
 Siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases 
their capacity to hold and transport water, interferes with navigation 
in downstream harbors, and harms flora and fauna. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6438939" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(6)</span>
 Sediment from soil erosion clogs catch basins, storm sewers and ditches
 and pollutes and silts streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and harbors. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6438940" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(7)</span>
 Impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff 
and allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing 
groundwater recharge and stream base flow. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6438941" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(8)</span>
 Improperly managed stormwater runoff can increase the incidence of 
flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering property and 
human life. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6438942" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(9)</span> Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on community waters. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6438943" style="margin-left:2em"><span class="titleLink">(10)</span> Many future problems can be avoided if land is developed or retrofitted with sound stormwater runoff management practices. </div>   </div>

The preservation and maintenance of trees is necessary to protect the 
health, safety, environment, ecosystems and general welfare of the 
inhabitants of the Village of Scarsdale. Trees provide necessary shade, 
green space and aesthetic appeal, impede soil erosion, aid water 
absorption and provide other environmental benefits and generally 
enhance the quality of life within the Village. The destruction and 
damage of trees and the indiscriminate and excessive cutting of trees 
cause barren and unsightly conditions, create surface drainage problems,
 increase municipal costs to control drainage, impair the value of real 
property and adversely affect the character of the community. This 
article seeks to address these conditions. </div>

 Legislative findings and intent. The Village of Scarsdale wishes to 
promote the reliable delivery by public utilities of electric power to 
residents and businesses within the Village. The Village recognizes that
 tree limbs may interrupt such reliable delivery if they become 
entangled with electric lines and therefore public utilities must, from 
time to time, cut and/or remove trees. The Village also wishes to 
recognize and preserve the benefits of trees to the community, 
including, without limitation, flood mitigation, water purification, 
reduced soil erosion, removal of carbon dioxide from the air, providing 
protection from the elements and reduced use of fossil fuels for heating
 and air conditioning and preservation of neighborhood character. 
Removal of trees may lead to soil erosion, stormwater runoff and related
 drainage problems, which, if not regulated locally, would be 
deleterious to the environment and adversely impact all property in the 
Village. </div> <div class="litem1" id="12703225" style="margin-left:1em"><span class="titleLink">B.</span>
 Any tree work in the Village right-of-way by a public utility, or its 
agent, including trimming and/or removal of trees must comply with 
nationally recognized standards and, further, that when tree removal is 
necessary, reasonable efforts are to be made to mitigate the loss of 
trees and any resulting threat by such removal by replanting, or such 
other actions that are necessary to protect the public health, safety, 
environment and general welfare. </div> <div class="litem1" id="12703226" style="margin-left:1em"><span class="titleLink">C.</span>
 Utilities or their agents responsible for maintaining ROWs in the 
Village shall follow the tree maintenance practices for utilities 
established by the National Arbor Day Foundation, as amended from time 
to time, unless otherwise authorized in writing by a tree expert under 
such terms and conditions as may be specified. Nothing in this article 
prevents a public utility from contracting with a private entity to 
perform tree maintenance, as long as such tree maintenance conforms to 
the standards established by the National Arbor Day Foundation and 
provisions of this Article <span class="xref">II</span>. </div> <div class="litem1" id="12703227" style="margin-left:1em"><span class="titleLink">D.</span> Except for tree pruning and trimming permitted by Subsection <span class="xref">B</span>
 above, no utility or its agents or contractors shall cut, top or remove
 a tree on a Village ROW, unless such tree poses a danger to a 
distribution line. A certification by a tree expert that such tree(s) 
are diseased or dying or, with respect to a healthy tree, such tree is 
so entangled with a distribution line that pruning and maintenance 
practices cannot reasonably be expected to prevent such tree from 
falling on or otherwise interfering with the distribution line is to be 
filed with the Village Engineer before any work takes place. 
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Article <span class="xref">II</span>,
 an entity may trim, top or remove a tree on a ROW if it has fallen on a
 distribution line or, in the judgment of the utility, is in imminent 
danger of doing so. </div> <div class="litem1" id="12703228" style="margin-left:1em"><span class="titleLink">E.</span> Except for tree pruning and trimming maintenance practices permitted by this Article <span class="xref">II</span>,
 any public utility or other entity removing a tree on a ROW or trimming
 to such a degree that would constitute removal, including if done on an
 emergency basis, shall replant a replacement tree for each such tree 
removed and take such action as shall be determined by the utility's 
consulting tree expert so that no adverse environmental effects, 
including, but not limited to, drainage and soil erosion, impact the 
Village or adjacent property owners. All replacement trees shall be 
native trees for this region as designated either by the County of

 Purposes and objectives. To guide future growth of the Scarsdale 
Village Center in a manner consistent with historical patterns of 
building development and land use; and to establish a carefully designed
 and orderly development plan that will protect the public health, 
safety, morals and general welfare; and to promote and implement the 
comprehensive planning policies and objectives of the Village Board of 
Trustees, the Village Center Area District, as shown on a map entitled 
"Scarsdale Village Center Zoning Map," dated March 28, 1988, revised 
November 1, 1988, including the more specific zones for each block or 
portion thereof as shown thereon, is hereby officially established and 
adopted as the Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Map for the Scarsdale 
Village Center Area.  </div> <div class="litem2" id="6439945" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439945">(1)</a> The underlying long-range planning policies and objectives for the Village Center Area are as follows:  </div> <div class="litem3" id="6439946" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439946">(a)</a>  To maintain the present character of the Village Center. </div> <div class="litem3" id="6439947" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439947">(b)</a>  To improve traffic and parking conditions. </div> <div class="litem3" id="6439948" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439948">(c)</a>
  To help meet the needs of the community for alternate housing 
opportunities, including senior citizen housing, and for commercial uses
 related to community needs. </div> <div class="litem3" id="6439949" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439949">(d)</a>  To maintain a downtown that is functional and attractive to residents and serves as a community focal point. </div>  <div class="litem2" id="6439950" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439950">(2)</a>
 It is the intent of this section that development for the foregoing 
purposes does not have to produce a net tax revenue benefit, and neither
 should it impose a financial tax burden upon the Village. </div>  <div class="litem1" id="6439951" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439951">B.</a>
 Village Center Area Zones. The following separate zones applying to 
specific areas are hereby established within the framework of the 
Village Center Area District for the purposes specified and in 
accordance with the regulations as set forth for each:  </div> <div class="litem2" id="6439952" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439952">(1)</a> Village Center Retail - 2.0 (VCR - 2.0).  </div> <div class="litem3" id="6439953" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439953">(a)</a>
  It is the purpose of this zone to preserve the existing architectural 
character while reflecting the present nature and intensity of land use 
in the heart of the Scarsdale Village Center Area and at the same time 
strengthening its pedestrian shopping pattern. It is recognized that the
 historical development pattern in this zone is such that the only 
available parking for existing developed properties is, and will 
continue to be, that provided in Village parking facilities. However, 
any proposals for additional building development or for conversion from
 residential to commercial use should be permitted only if all 
off-street parking requirements which would result from such an approval
 can be satisfied on private property by the applicant. The permitted 
uses within this zone are intended to balance its land use function with
 its parking limitations. </div> <div class="litem3" id="6439954" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439954">(b)</a>
  In the Village Center Retail - 2.0 Zone, no building or premises shall
 be used or maintained and no building shall hereafter be erected, 
enlarged or altered if, as so erected or as a result of such enlargement
 or alteration, such building or any part thereof is arranged, designed 
or intended to be used for any except the following principal purposes: 
 </div> <div class="litem4" id="6439955" style="margin-left:4em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439955">[1]</a>
  Ground floor: retail stores, personal service establishments,

  It is the purpose of this zone to encourage the continuation of the 
present pattern of land use and development in a portion of the 
Scarsdale Village Center Area which forms an extension of a business 
district primarily located in the adjacent area of the Town of 
Eastchester. It is recognized that the historical pattern of building 
development in this area precludes any substantial provision of on-site 
parking and that the primary responsibility for meeting those needs will
 continue to rest with the Village. Any proposal for additional building
 development or for conversion from residential to commercial use should
 be permitted only if all off-street parking requirements which would 
result from such an approval can be satisfied on private property by the
 applicant. </div> <div class="litem3" id="6439960" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439960">(b)</a>
  In the Village Center Retail - 1.0 Zone, no building or premises shall
 be used or maintained and no building shall hereafter be erected,

  It is the purpose of this zone to recognize the existing character of 
land use and building development in retail blocks located adjacent to 
the heart of the Village Center Area and to encourage their continued 
function as an important element of the central pedestrian shopping 
pattern. Although, for the most part, the properties within these blocks
 will need to continue to rely upon the Village to satisfy their 
off-street parking requirements, any existing off-street parking must be
 continued, or at least replaced in kind, in connection with the 
approval of any future changes, unless such parking exceeds the 
requirements of this chapter, in which case it shall not be reduced 
below such requirements. </div> <div class="litem3" id="6439966" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439966">(b)</a>

 be used or maintained and no building shall hereafter be erected,

  It is the purpose of this zone to recognize the existence of an office
 building development within the Village Center Area and to establish 
standards and requirements in relation to it which will allow its 
continued use, but not its intensification, in a reasonable manner 
consistent with the achievement of the Village's long-range planning 
policies. Any existing off-street parking must be continued in 
connection with the approval of any future changes, unless such parking 
exceeds the requirements of this chapter, in which case it shall not be 
reduced below such requirements. </div> <div class="litem3" id="6439971" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439971">(b)</a>

  It is the purpose of this zone to allow the continued use and 
development of a portion of the Village Center Area for retail and 
service business purposes, including some which may not be functionally 
appropriate within the heart of the Village Center Area but which are 
nevertheless recognized as being necessary to serve the commercial needs
 of Village residents. Standards governing the height of buildings and 
the type and intensity of land use in this district are designed to 
recognize the existing lot size and development pattern in this area, as
 well as the nature of neighboring land uses, and to allow for all 
future parking needs to be met on site. </div> <div class="litem3" id="6439976" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439976">(b)</a>

significant site in a transitional location on the periphery of the 
Village Center in a manner intended to achieve the accomplishment of the
 Village's long-range planning policies and objectives, including, in

 Design review. The Village Center Area, because of its distinctive 
architectural style, its historical pattern and character of building 
development, its open spaces and vistas and its role as an important 
community focal point, is hereby designated as a special design 
district. The purpose of this designation shall be to assure that the 
construction, reconstruction, modification, alteration, enlargement or 
other change in the design of buildings and uses on properties within 
the Village Center Area is in harmony with the established design 
character of such area, is consistent with the preservation of the 
economic value of other properties situated therein and is otherwise 
consistent with the purposes of this Comprehensive Zoning Plan.  </div> <div class="litem2" id="6439994" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439994">(1)</a>

 Design guidelines. It is the objective of the guidelines hereinbelow 
set forth to establish a general design framework which will maintain 
and respect the present architectural character and scale of buildings 
in the Village Center Area, ensure that the area continues to develop as
 an attractive, convenient and secure center which functions as a focal 
point for local residents, provides a blending of landscaped open space 
and structures which relate harmoniously to their immediate neighborhood
 and to the Village as a whole and provides visual interest and variety 
in the treatment of facades, roofs, sidewalks and landscaped areas. In 
reviewing applications for site plan approval for properties in the 
Village Center Area, the Planning Board may attach more or less weight 
to any guideline in relation to other guidelines, as may be appropriate 
under the particular circumstances presented by a specific application, 
including without limitation the character of existing or proposed uses 
adjacent to the property which is the subject of the application. The 
guidelines are set forth in Subsection <a class="xref" href="http://ecode360.com/print/%%%XREF6439997#6439997%%%">C(3)(a)</a>, <a class="xref" href="http://ecode360.com/print/%%%XREF6440017#6440017%%%">(b)</a>, <a class="xref" href="http://ecode360.com/print/%%%XREF6440028#6440028%%%">(c)</a> and <a class="xref" href="http://ecode360.com/print/%%%XREF6440035#6440035%%%">(d)</a> below:  </div> <div class="litem3" id="6439997" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6439997">(a)</a>

 Incentive density. It is recognized that the PUD zones established 
within the Village Center Area are unique because they, encompass the 
largest sites and the major portion of the areas future development 
potential. As such, they represent the most significant opportunity for 
the achievement of the basic public benefit purposes and objectives of 
the Village Center Area. Therefore, to provide an incentive which will 
further encourage the most appropriate use and development of those 
sites in a manner designed to achieve the Village's adopted planning 
objectives, the Village Board of Trustees may allow, by special permit 
and following a public hearing held on notice duly given in the same 
manner as is required by law for zoning amendments, an increased FAR 
and/or building height or special uses, within the limits as set forth 
in Subsection <a class="xref" href="http://ecode360.com/print/%%%XREF6440091#6440091%%%">A</a>
 hereof and subject to the provision of specific public benefit 
features. It may also choose not to allow any such change or increase. 
Village Board action on such an application shall be taken only after 
review of the proposed plan by the Planning Board and the submission of a
 report and recommendation by said Board to the Trustees. Final site 
plan approval by the Planning Board shall not occur until after the 
special permit determination by the Village Board. The incentive 
features, and the guidelines for Village Board action, are as described 
below:  </div> <div class="litem2" id="6440114" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440114">(1)</a>
  The specific public benefit features for which incentive density 
increases may be granted in the PUD -- 1.0 to 2.0 Zone are as follows:  </div> <div class="litem3" id="6440115" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440115">(a)</a>
  The provision of street improvements and parking spaces for short-term
 use beyond that which is required to serve the specific development 
proposed and designed to mitigate the problems of traffic and parking 
congestion in the Village Center Area. </div> <div class="litem3" id="6440116" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440116">(b)</a>
  The provision of housing units specifically designed for, and limited 
in occupancy to, senior citizens, with priority for Scarsdale residents.
 </div> <div class="litem3" id="6440117" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440117">(c)</a>
  The provision of special design amenities available for public use and
 enjoyment which would enhance the function and/or appearance of the 
Village Center Area, including but not limited to pedestrian linkages, 
plazas, fountains, artworks, sitting and other passive recreation areas,
 special landscape design features and other such similar improvements; 
conversely, the removal of existing features which detract from the 
function and/or appearance of said area, including but not limited to 
overhead utility lines, unattractive structures and other such features.
 </div> <div class="litem3" id="6440118" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440118">(d)</a>
  The provision of commercial uses designed specifically to serve 
convenience shopping needs, including but not limited to such 
establishments as food markets, bakeries, butcher shops, pharmacies, dry
 cleaners, card shops, variety goods stores, hardware stores, beauty 
salons, barbershops, shoe repair shops and other businesses of a similar
 nature as determined by the Village Board. </div>  <div class="litem2" id="6440119" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440119">(2)</a>
  Due to the significant shortage of short-term parking in the PUD -- 
0.8 to 1.4 portion of the Village Center Area, any density incentive 
increase granted within that zone shall be only for the provision of 
publicly available short-term parking spaces. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6440120" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440120">(3)</a>
  In determining the specific amount of density incentive increase that

  The degree of compatibility of such incentive features with the 
neighborhood in which they are located, taking into consideration the 
potential effects of noise, traffic, fumes, vibrations or other such 
characteristics on surrounding streets and properties, the visual impact
 of the resultant density increase and/or incentive feature applied for 
and the impact of the proposed development upon access to light, air and
 vistas known to be important to the community. </div> <div class="litem3" id="6440124" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440124">(d)</a>
  The consistency of such incentive features with the Village's 
comprehensive planning and capital improvement program objectives as set
 forth in this chapter and in related studies and plans prepared for the
 Village or as otherwise promulgated and declared by the Village Board 
of Trustees. </div> <div class="litem3" id="6440125" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440125">(e)</a>
  The quality of design of the proposed development as determined by the
 Planning Board in accordance with its review under §&nbsp;<a class="xref" href="http://ecode360.com/print/%%%XREF6439993#6439993%%%">310-12C</a> hereof. </div> <div class="litem3" id="6440126" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440126">(f)</a>
  The amount of incentive density increase necessary to more than offset
 the cost of providing the incentive feature(s), thereby creating the 
incentive for providing such feature(s). </div>  <div class="litem2" id="6440127" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440127">(4)</a>
  No incentive density increase will be granted for the construction of 
any improvement which, in the Village Board's opinion, would otherwise 
be required by this chapter or other applicable regulation. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6440128" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440128">(5)</a>
  To assist the Village Board in determining the appropriate amount of 
density increase, if any, to grant as an incentive for the applicant's 
provision of the proposed public benefit feature(s), the applicant shall
 submit an estimate of the cost of providing the proposed feature(s) and
 the value of the density increase requested. The Village Board may also
 engage its own independent experts to either separately prepare such 
analyses or to review those prepared by the applicant. The reasonable 
cost of such expert assistance shall be reimbursed to the Village by the
 applicant. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6440129" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440129">(6)</a>
  In determining the specific amount of density increase to be granted, 
if any, the following additional factors, specific to certain benefit 
features to be provided, will guide the Village Board:  </div> <div class="litem3" id="6440130" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440130">(a)</a>

  Design amenities. In determining the amount of density increase, if 
any, to be granted as an incentive for the provision of special design 
amenities, the Village Board will take into consideration, in addition

invites and encourages their public use and enjoyment. </div> <div class="litem3" id="6440147" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440147">(d)</a>
  Convenience commercial uses. In determining the amount of density 
increase, if any, to be granted as an incentive for the provision of 
commercial uses designed to serve convenience shopping needs, the 
Village Board will take into consideration the categories of use to 
which the floor space is to be restricted, the permanency of those 
restrictions, the location of the proposed restricted floor space and 
other such similar factors related to the achievement of the Village's 
policy objectives. </div>  <div class="litem2" id="6440148" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440148">(7)</a>
  In addition to the foregoing guidelines, the Village Board may take

 Special parking district. For any lot or building within the area 
designated as a special parking district, as shown on a map entitled 
"Scarsdale Village Center Zoning Map," dated March 28, 1988, revised 
November 1, 1988, adopted and referred to in §&nbsp;<a class="xref" href="http://ecode360.com/print/%%%XREF6439857#6439857%%%">310-4</a>
 hereof, which map amends the map entitled "Special Parking District 
Station Business Area, Scarsdale, New York," dated February 13, 1979, 
the following modifications to the off-street parking requirements as 
set forth above shall apply.  </div> <div class="litem2" id="6440299" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440299">(1)</a>
 There shall be no requirement to provide off-street parking spaces for 
any use of land or buildings legally existing on the date of adoption of
 this amendment or for a changed use which would not result in any 
increased off-street parking requirement in accordance with the 
standards set forth above, provided that:  </div> <div class="litem3" id="6440300" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440300">(a)</a>
  Any parking spaces existing on such premises at that date are 
continued in such use or that alternate parking spaces, subject to 
location and design approval by the Planning Board, are established to 
replace them; </div> <div class="litem3" id="6440301" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440301">(b)</a>
  Any existing agreements for the provision of off-street parking 
spaces, including agreements to purchase Village parking permits, which 
may have been previously approved by the Village of Scarsdale or any 
agency, board or commission thereof shall continue in full force and 
effect unless modified by the parties thereto; and </div> <div class="litem3" id="6440302" style="margin-left:3em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440302">(c)</a>
  For the purpose of this requirement, any existing floor space which 
may be vacant on the date of the adoption of this amendment shall be 
considered to have been in use for the purpose for which it had last 
been used on a regular basis prior to its becoming vacant. </div>  <div class="litem2" id="6440303" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440303">(2)</a>
 If the use of any existing premises is changed in such a way as to 
increase the minimum number of off-street parking spaces which would be 
required on such premises in accordance with the standards as set forth 
in Subsection <a class="xref" href="http://ecode360.com/print/%%%XREF6440286#6440286%%%">A(1)</a> through <a class="xref" href="http://ecode360.com/print/%%%XREF6440295#6440295%%%">(10)</a>
 above, such increased number of off-street required parking spaces 
shall be provided and maintained on private premises by the applicant. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6440304" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440304">(3)</a>
 Alternatively, in a special parking district, the applicant for such 
change may request the Planning Board to accept a cash payment to the 
Village of Scarsdale Parking Enterprise Revenue Fund in lieu of 
providing some or any of such parking, and the Planning Board, in its 
discretion, may elect to accept such payment on behalf of the Village. 
The amount of the cash payment required for each parking space shall be 
established and may from time to time be amended by the Village Board of
 Trustees. The expenditure of parking fund revenues shall be limited 
exclusively to those actions designed to provide parking spaces to serve
 properties within the special parking district. </div> <div class="litem2" id="6440305" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440305">(4)</a>
 In the PUD - 1.0 District, the Village Board of Trustees may negotiate a
 lump sum cash payment, or a combination of land dedication and a cash 
payment, to the Village in lieu of an applicant providing some or all of
 the required off-street parking spaces. In such a case, the Village 
would assume the responsibility for the construction and maintenance of 
said parking, including the determination of the manner and basis upon 
which the parking will be designed and allocated to meet the needs of 
the various uses which it is intended to serve. </div>  <div class="litem1" id="6440306" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440306">C.</a>
 Planning Board waiver. Where, because of the specific nature of a 
particular nonresidential use of land or buildings or because of 
probable variation in the time of peak parking demand in the case of a 
mixed-use development, the Planning Board determines that the provision 
of the minimum number of off-street parking spaces as determined on the 
basis of the above standards may not actually be needed, the Planning 
Board may, subject to such special standards, limitations or conditions 
as it may deem appropriate, waive or modify the requirement for the 
construction of up to 1/3 of such number of spaces. </div> <div class="litem1" id="6440307" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440307">D.</a>

																																															<div class="content">  
The Village has received and expects to receive requests to site 
wireless telecommunications facilities within its municipal boundaries. 
It is the intent of the Village to protect and promote the health, 
safety and general welfare of its residents by establishing an orderly 
process for regulating the siting of wireless telecommunications 
facilities while balancing the need for adequate service levels. 
Therefore, the purposes of this article are to establish standards for 
the safe provision of telecommunications services consistent with 
applicable state and federal law; to minimize the adverse visual impact 
of wireless telecommunications facilities through proper design, site 
placement, height limitation and vegetative screening and thereby to 
retain the residential character of the Village and to maintain property
 values; and to encourage the shared use of wireless telecommunications 
facilities. In furtherance of these goals, the Village shall give 
consideration to the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Map, existing land uses 
and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location 
of wireless telecommunications facilities. While the Village has no 
control over the use of county and state lands, in recognition of the 
fact that there are approximately 900 acres of county and state lands 
within the Village, telecommunications providers will be encouraged, if 
consistent with the provisions of this article, to consider sites on 
these lands in addition to those under Village jurisdiction. </div>

 The unique character of residential neighborhoods in Scarsdale rests on
 the diversity in the style and design of houses as well as the general 
uniformity in the scale of houses located on similarly sized lots in 
neighborhoods throughout the community. The recent trend of tearing down
 existing houses and replacing them with larger houses or building large
 additions to existing houses threatens the appearance and impacts upon 
the health, safety, welfare, and quality of life of Scarsdale. </div> <div class="litem1" id="6440594" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440594">B.</a>
 This article establishes a maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for all 
single-family and two-family residences in the Residence A Zones. It 
responds both to the desire of residents to enlarge their homes to meet 
the needs of their families and to preserve neighborhood character by 
requiring houses to appear to be of the same or similar scale to others 
in the neighborhood. It is the intent of this article to encourage both 
new houses and expansions or alterations to existing houses to have a 
consistent scale with the nearby residences on both sides of the street.
 The FAR provisions are intended to be applied together with other 
provisions of the Village Code, including the provisions for lot 
coverage. </div>  </div>

Commission. The relief requested may specifically include the exemption 
from or delay in implementation (as to the petitioning franchisee or 
cable operator only) of one or more provisions of these rules or that a 
specific provision be required for only part of any franchise term. The 
petition shall set forth the relief requested and the basis thereof with
 such supporting information and material as may be applicable. </div> <div class="litem1" id="6440704" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440704">B.</a>
 In order to receive any relief from one or more of the provisions of 
these rules, a franchisee or cable operator must satisfactorily 
demonstrate to the Commission that at least one of the following facts 
exists:  </div> <div class="litem2" id="6440705" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440705">(1)</a>

regulations; </div> <div class="litem2" id="6440706" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440706">(2)</a>
 Where applicable, the provision in question materially affects and is 
in conflict with an express right that is specifically noted in an 
existing franchise agreement, but only for the term of the existing 
franchise [This provision covers situations where a franchisee seeks and
 is granted modification of an existing franchise agreement under 
§&nbsp;625 of the Federal Cable Act (Cable Communications Policy Act of 
1984, Public Law 98-549, as amended by the Cable Television Consumer 
Protection and Competition Act of 1992, Public Law 102-385, amending 47

comparable to or exceeding any provision and/or requirement from which 
the operator seeks relief; or </div> <div class="litem2" id="6440710" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440710">(6)</a> The health, safety and welfare interests of the Village otherwise warrant the granting of such relief. </div>  <div class="litem1" id="6440711" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440711">C.</a>
 Unless delegated to another authorized representative of the Village, 
the Commission shall have the responsibility of determining whether a 
franchisee's or cable operator's construction, maintenance, operations

provision of these rules. </div> <div class="litem1" id="6440712" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440712">D.</a>
 As an alternative to seeking an exemption or requesting relief, a

precise intent and effect that one or more provisions or sections of 
these rules or regulations has on the petitioning franchisee or cable 
operator. </div> <div class="litem1" id="6440713" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440713">E.</a>
 The Commission may charge the petitioning franchisee or cable operator 
with the actual costs for processing such a petition, including any 
costs incurred by outside consultants who are retained by the Village to
 review the petition; provided, however, that no such charge may be 
imposed upon a franchisee or cable operator that is otherwise committed 
to pay a franchise fee that is at the maximum limit of such fees 
pursuant to applicable law, unless the franchisee or cable operator, by 
petition, seeks a substantial waiver of material provisions of these 
rules previously understood to be applicable to the franchisee or cable 
operator, and such petition causes the Village to incur administrative 
costs not previously anticipated in the determination of the franchise 
fee. </div> <div class="litem1" id="6440714" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440714">F.</a>
 In those instances where the Commission issues an order granting an 
exemption or relief for a franchisee or cable operator or deems a 
petitioner's operational policy to be comparable to a provision(s) in 
the rules, then the franchise agreement (initial, existing or renewal) 
shall be amended within 60 days to reflect the exact extent of such 
exemption and/or relief; provided, however, that a failure to so amend a
 franchise agreement shall not subject the franchisee to liability if 
the exemption or relief was properly granted. It should be specifically 
noted that the benefit of such exemption, relief, clarification or 
comparable policy extends only to the franchisee or cable operator 
granted such exemption, relief, clarification or comparable policy. </div> <div class="litem1" id="6440715" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6440715">G.</a>

 In considering an application for a building permit for houses that may
 appear to be out-of-scale, the Board of Architectural Review may 
consider the extent to which the house successfully employs design 
techniques which reduce the appearance of scale and aid in keeping the 
house in scale with those houses to which they are adjacent and which 
are located on similarly sized lots in the neighborhood. Also, in 
considering an area variance application that would allow a house to 
exceed the maximum permitted FAR pursuant to §&nbsp;<a class="xref" href="http://ecode360.com/print/%%%XREF6440603#6440603%%%">310-102</a>,
 the Zoning Board of Appeals may consider the extent to which the house 
successfully employs such design techniques. The design guidelines set 
forth below illustrate ways in which new or expanded houses may reduce 
the appearance of scale, thereby blending in with the established 
character of the neighborhood. However, the Board of Architectural 
Review, the Zoning Board of Appeals and the applicant shall not be 
limited to the guidelines set forth below and may consider other design 
techniques which reduce the appearance of scale and preserve 
neighborhood character. Wherever possible, additions should be placed to
 the rear of the main or principal structure, at a height below the 
principal structure, with a different roofline than the principal 
structure, and stepped back from the side walls of the principal 
structure. <div class="graphic"><a href="http://ecode360.com/documents/SC0993/0993-A321a%20Subsection%201A%20Rear%20Addition.tif.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="graphic" src="Village%20of%20Scarsdale,%20NY_files/0993-A321a%2520Subsection%25201A%2520Rear%2520Addition.jpg" style="margin-left:1em" title=""></a></div> </div> <div class="litem1" id="6441264" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441264">B.</a> If additions are placed to the side of the main or principal structure, such addition should have, wherever possible:  </div> <div class="litem2" id="6441265" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441265">(1)</a> A roof height below that of the principal structure; </div> <div class="litem2" id="6441266" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441266">(2)</a> A roofline different from the principal structure; </div> <div class="litem2" id="6441267" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441267">(3)</a> A front facade that is set back from the front facade of the principal structure; and </div> <div class="litem2" id="6441268" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441268">(4)</a> A front facade whose width is less than that of the principal structure. <div class="graphic"><a href="http://ecode360.com/documents/SC0993/0993-A321b%20Subsection%201B%20Side%20Addition%20Design.tif.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="graphic" src="Village%20of%20Scarsdale,%20NY_files/0993-A321b%252520Subsection%2525201B%252520Side%252520Addition%252520D.jpg" style="margin-left:2em" title=""></a></div> </div>  <div class="litem1" id="6441269" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441269">C.</a>
 Additions to the front of the house are discouraged, unless they are 
covered entryways, porticoes or open porches. If additions are placed to
 the front of the main or principal structure, the addition should not 
completely obscure the facade of the principal structure or the main 
entry. More specifically, the addition should have, wherever possible:  </div> <div class="litem2" id="6441270" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441270">(1)</a> A roof height below that of the principal structure; </div> <div class="litem2" id="6441271" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441271">(2)</a> A roofline different from the principal structure; </div> <div class="litem2" id="6441272" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441272">(3)</a> Side walls that are set back from the side walls of the principal structure; and </div> <div class="litem2" id="6441273" style="margin-left:2em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441273">(4)</a> A front facade whose width is less than that of the principal structure. </div>  <div class="litem1" id="6441274" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441274">D.</a>
 Wherever possible, the depth of the property should be used to 
accommodate the addition, rather than adding to the width and front 
facade of the house. <div class="graphic"><a href="http://ecode360.com/documents/SC0993/0993-A321c%20Subsection%201D.tif.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="graphic" src="Village%20of%20Scarsdale,%20NY_files/0993-A321c%2520Subsection%25201D.jpg" style="margin-left:1em" title=""></a></div> </div> <div class="litem1" id="6441275" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441275">E.</a>
 Shallow-pitched rooflines should be avoided, particularly on squat, 
rectangular building forms; rooflines should be visually proportional to
 the part of the structure that the roof covers. In general, the 
vertical distance between the eave and the highest point of the roof 
should be about the same height as one of the building stories. <div class="graphic"><a href="http://ecode360.com/documents/SC0993/0993-A321d%20Subsection%201E.tif.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="graphic" src="Village%20of%20Scarsdale,%20NY_files/0993-A321d%2520Subsection%25201E.jpg" style="margin-left:1em" title=""></a></div> </div> <div class="litem1" id="6441276" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441276">F.</a>
 Where attached garages are provided, they should be set back from the 
front building facade, preferably with the garage doors facing the side 
or rear. The roofline of the attached garage should be different from 
the portion of the structure to which it is attached. Where the garage 
entryway must face the street, double-wide garage doors should be 
avoided. No more than one living story should be located over the 
garage, unless the garage is below grade and faces the side or rear 
property line. The roof height of the attached garage should be lower 
than that of the principal structure. <div class="graphic"><a href="http://ecode360.com/documents/SC0993/0993-A321e%20Subsection%201F.tif.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="graphic" src="Village%20of%20Scarsdale,%20NY_files/0993-A321e%2520Subsection%25201F.jpg" style="margin-left:1em" title=""></a></div> </div> <div class="litem1" id="6441277" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441277">G.</a>
 Garages attached to the front of the main structure are discouraged. 
However, where provided, side-entry is preferred, with the front facade 
of the garage matching that of the principal structure. <div class="graphic"><a href="http://ecode360.com/documents/SC0993/0993-A321f%20Subsection%201G.tif.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="graphic" src="Village%20of%20Scarsdale,%20NY_files/0993-A321f%2520Subsection%25201G.jpg" style="margin-left:1em" title=""></a></div> </div> <div class="litem1" id="6441278" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441278">H.</a>
 Wherever possible, the height of the addition should match or be lower 
than the height of the adjacent principal structure at the setback line.
 The height and setback of the new or expanded portion of the house 
should not be out of scale with that of the houses on the adjoining 
properties. <div class="graphic"><a href="http://ecode360.com/documents/SC0993/0993-A321g%20Subsection%201H.tif.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="graphic" src="Village%20of%20Scarsdale,%20NY_files/0993-A321g%2520Subsection%25201H.jpg" style="margin-left:1em" title=""></a></div> </div> <div class="litem1" id="6441279" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441279">I.</a>
 Projections or recessed building elements should be used to create 
breaks in the plane or front facade of a house. Changes in the roofline 
or the addition of roof elements may also reduce the appearance of scale
 of the house. Examples of such elements include projecting eaves, 
dormers, decorative chimneys, porticos, open porches, outdoor stairways 
and stoops. <div class="graphic"><a href="http://ecode360.com/documents/SC0993/0993-A321h%20Subsection%201I.tif.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="graphic" src="Village%20of%20Scarsdale,%20NY_files/0993-A321h%2520Subsection%25201I.jpg" style="margin-left:1em" title=""></a></div> </div> <div class="litem1" id="6441280" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441280">J.</a>
 The proportion of window and door openings of the additions (i.e., 
their width, height, location and design) should be visually compatible 
with the principal structure. <div class="graphic"><a href="http://ecode360.com/documents/SC0993/0993-A321i%20Subsection%201J.tif.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="graphic" src="Village%20of%20Scarsdale,%20NY_files/0993-A321i%2520Subsection%25201J.jpg" style="margin-left:1em" title=""></a></div> </div> <div class="litem1" id="6441281" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441281">K.</a>
 Varied housing design is encouraged; however the style of additions or 
added elements should be in keeping with the style of the principal 
structure. <div class="graphic"><a href="http://ecode360.com/documents/SC0993/0993-A321j%20Subsection%201K.tif.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="graphic" src="Village%20of%20Scarsdale,%20NY_files/0993-A321j%2520Subsection%25201K.jpg" style="margin-left:1em" title=""></a></div> </div> <div class="litem1" id="6441282" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441282">L.</a>
 Undifferentiated rectangular building forms and rooflines should be 
avoided. The mass of the house should be broken into two or more 
complementary forms with differing heights and setback lines and with 
distinct rooflines and building planes. These "broken planes" create 
architectural texture and variety, helping to reduce the overall 
appearance of scale. <div class="graphic"><a href="http://ecode360.com/documents/SC0993/0993-A321k%20Subsection%201L.tif.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="graphic" src="Village%20of%20Scarsdale,%20NY_files/0993-A321k%2520Subsection%25201L.jpg" style="margin-left:1em" title=""></a></div> </div> <div class="litem1" id="6441283" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441283">M.</a>
 Architectural elements such as shutters, mullioned windows, differing 
building materials, textures and colors should be used to relieve the 
monotony of large blank facades. <div class="graphic"><a href="http://ecode360.com/documents/SC0993/0993-A321l%20Subsection%201M.tif.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="graphic" src="Village%20of%20Scarsdale,%20NY_files/0993-A321l%2520Subsection%25201M.jpg" style="margin-left:1em" title=""></a></div> </div> <div class="litem1" id="6441284" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441284">N.</a> Enclosing existing open porches should be avoided since this can add to the appearance of scale. </div> <div class="litem1" id="6441285" style="margin-left:1em"><a class="titleLink" href="#6441285">O.</a>
 The incorporation of design elements such as those discussed above 
which reduce the appearance of the scale of the house is the preferred 
method of maintaining the character of the neighborhood and community. 
However, where these or other design techniques cannot be utilized, are 
not appropriate, or are insufficient to reduce the appearance of scale, 
the planting of vegetation to screen the house should be utilized to 
reduce the visual impact of a house. The use of walls, fences or berms 
to provide such screening is discouraged. </div>  </div>
